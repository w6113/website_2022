The shepherd job is copied below.  The shepherds are responsible for putting together the final review and ensuring the every review for the paper is high quality and constructive.

* Lead the discussion during the PC meeting
* Work with the individual reviewers to ensure that the reviews are complete, positive, constructive, and reflect the discussion.
* Work with the authors during the rest of the semester to ensure that the final version of the paper meets the standards from the PC discussion.
* In short, the paper’s success is tied to the Shephard’s success.
